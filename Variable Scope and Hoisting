lETS LOOK AFTER THIS EXAMPLE

var a = 'abc';
var b = 'def';

function fn() {
    a = 123; //change in outer scope.
    var b = 456;
    console.log(a, b)
}

fn();

This funtion gives output 123, 456. 
Because b takes the value of declarartion from local scope of function and 
a gives the input change for global scope variable inside the function.


lets look Deeper

var x = 5; //Global Variable
var y = 10;

function fn() {
    var y = 20;
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
}

fn(); // 5 // 20 

console.log(x); // 5 
console.log(y); // 10

x take value from global scope and y take the local scope . in fn but take global scope outside of function.
Note: There’s a mechanism behind variable lookup in JavaScript. When we try to access a variable, 
the JavasScript engine first looks at the current scope level. If the variable isn’t found, 
it will jump upwards into the parent scope and look there, and keep going upwards 
and out until it either finds the variable or reaches the global scope.



//Now Variable Hoisting

lets look a example first
console.log(x) -> undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x) -> 5
console.log(y) // yis not defined

Why x gives undefined and y gives error?
Javascript variable declaration is hoisted or moved to the top of their available scope. The code runs like

var x;
console.log(x)
x=5;
console.log(5)
console.log(y)

Note that only the variable declaration, not the assignment, is hoisted.


//function Hoisting
fnDeclaration(); // -> This works!
fnExpression(); // -> Uncaught TypeError: fnExpression is not a function

function fnDeclaration() {
    console.log('This works!');
}

var fnExpression = function() {
    console.log("This won't work :(");
}
