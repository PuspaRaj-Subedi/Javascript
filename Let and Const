Let is similar to the var
Different is 
 1. Not hoisted
 2. Block Scoped
 3. Duplicate declaration Fails
 
 #Not Hoisted means if we call the variable before defining and declaration then it gives error as 
 
 Example:
 
 console.log(x) -> error
 let x = 5; 
 console.log(x) -> 5
 
 But in var first line gives us undefined beacause var declaration is moved to the top of that scope.
 
 #Block scoped means it cannot be accessible from outside the blocked as 
 
 {
 let x = 5;
 console.log(x) -> 5
 }
 console.log(x) -> error
 
 
 ### Const
 It is similar as let.
  Different is : 
    1. cannot be reassigned
    2. no empty initializations
